            In a medium pot over medium heat melt the butter, add the flour and salt, whisk to combine well, add the
            milk slowly
            and stir constantly until the sauce has thickened (taste for salt). Remove from heat. (or you can purchase a
            good

            PUTTING IT TOGETHER

            In a baking dish measuring 10x10x2 (25x25x5 cm) spread 2-3 spoonfuls of meat sauce on the bottom of the pan,
            add a
            layer of lasagna noodles, then continue to layer in the following order, the meat sauce, white sauce,
            chopped
            mozzarella and parmesan cheese, continue making 3-4 layers, the last layer should be without the white
            sauce, so
            remember to divide the ingredients by 3 or 4, depending on how many layers you wish to make.
            Bake for approximate 20-30 minutes, or until cooked through. Let sit 5-10 minutes before serving. Enjoy!
